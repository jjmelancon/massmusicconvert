massmusicconvert is a Python3 script that recursively scans a directory in an effort to find music files. this list is passed to ffmpeg for conversion. i plan on extending this project to support more media files like videos in the future, as well as considering adding support for ripping music. this project is gplv3, use it however you would like.
